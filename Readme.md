# Learning Code in Multiple Programming Languages

## Languages are

### 1. C++

### 2. Java

### 3. Python

### 4. JavaScript

# Key Point in Coding

## 1. Data Types

There are 2 types of data types

### 1. Primitive Data Types:-

Basic types built into a programming language(e.g int, char, float, boolean in java).

### 2. Non-Primitive Data Types:-

Also known as reference types, these includes classes, arrays and interfaces in java.

## 1.1 C++

**1.1.1 Primitive data types in C++ :-**
- int: Integer type
- char: Character type
- bool: Boolean type (true or false)
- float: Floating-point type(single precision)
- double: Floating-point type(double precision)
- void: Represent absence of type
- wchar_t: Wide character type

**1.1.2 Non-primitive data types in C++ :-**
- Array: Collection of elements of same type
- Pointers: Variable that holds memory addresses
- References: Alias for another variable
- Structure (struct): Custom data types grouping different data types
- Union: Similar to structure but with shared memory
- Classes: User-defined data types(with methods and properties)
- Enums: Enumeration types

## 1.2 Java
**1.2.1 Primitive data types in Java :-**
- byte: 8-bit integer
- short: 16-bit integer
- int: 32-bit integer
- long: 64-bit integer
- float: Single precision 32-bit floating-point
- double: Double precision 64-bit floating-point
- char: 64-bit Unicode character
- boolean: True or False

**1.2.2 Non-primitive data types in Java :-**
- String: Sequence of characters
- Arrays: Collection of elements of same type
- Classes: User defined-data types(with methods and properties)
- Interfaces: Abstract types used to specify behavior
- Enums: Enumeration types

## 1.3 Python
**1.3.1 Primitive data types in Python :-**
- int: Integer type
- float: Floating-point types
- complex: Complex number type
- bool: Boolean type(true or false)
- str: String type(Sequence of characters)

**1.3.2 Non-primitive data types in Python :-**
- List: Ordered, mutable collection of elements
- Tuples: Ordered, immutable collection of elements
- Sets: Unordered collection of unique elements
- Dictionaries: Collections of key-value pairs
- Classes: User-defined data types(with methods and properties)
- Functions: First-class objects representing callable functions

## 1.4 JavaScript

#### 1.1.1 Primitive data types in JavaScript :-
- number: Numeric type (both integers and floating-points)
- string: Sequence of characters
- boolean: True or False
- undefined: A variable that has not been assigned a value
- null: Represents the intentional absence of any object value
- symbol: Unique and immutable data type introduced in ES6
- bigint: Arbitrary-precision integers introduced in ES2020 

#### 1.1.2 Non-primitive data types in JavaScript :-
- Objects: Collection of key-value pairs
- Arrays: Ordered collection of elements
- Functions: First-calls objects representing callable code
- Dates: Represents date and time
- RegExp: Represents regular expression
- Maps: Collection of key-value pairs with ordered keys (introduced in ES6)
- Sets: Collection of unique values (introduced in ES6)
